            <h1><span>Family</span></h1>
            <p>I came from a simple family, we're not rich we can just eat 3 times a day. I am close to my sisters. Sometimes we fight but we get along with each other foolishly. I also love kids, that's why I'm close to my nephews. Above all, I love my family very much.</p>

                    <p>I really appreciate my classmates now because they are humble and kind. Unlike my classmates when I was in jr.high school and sr.high, they're very competitive. I felt like I didn't belong among them. But now I love our batch. I feel like there's no competition at all.</p>

            <p>First of all I am not a friendly kind of person but Im easy to make friends with. I'm shy when I am not close to them but when I get closed to them I am crazy too. I have a lot of friends now but I have one friend, my bff that I really miss. She's been my classmate before, my best body and everything.</p>

                <h1>ACT-2 Family</h1>
                <p>For me our batch is a very nice batch. I felt like I enjoyed studying even though it was hard because honestly speaking this is the first time that I experienced this kind of group of people/classmates. A classmate that helps you to understand when you don't understand the lessons. Also advise you when you feel so down and want to stop in schooling. That's why for me Associate in Computer Technology (ACT) -2 batch is my favorite, and I will never forget this batch when I graduate.</p>
